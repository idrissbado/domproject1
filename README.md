### Shopping Cart Project
**Overview**
This project is a fully functional shopping cart application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The cart allows users to adjust item quantities, delete items, like items, and see the total price dynamically updated based on their actions.

**Features**
Adjust Quantity: Users can increase or decrease the quantity of each item using "+" and "-" buttons.

Delete Items: Users can remove items from the cart using a trash icon.

Like Items: Users can like items by clicking a heart-shaped button, which changes color to indicate the like status.
